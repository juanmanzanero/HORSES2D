# HORSES: a High Order Spectral Element Solver

![image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kj8zqel72zyolgv/Logo1.png?dl=0)


## This is a two dimensional discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method solver for the Navier-Stokes equations. 

This solver uses a **Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DG-SEM)** to solve the **Navier-Stokes** equations. **High-order** spectral element methods combine 
**accuracy** (by offering low dispersive and diffusive errors) with the **geometrical flexibility** of other methods, such as the Finite Volume 
Method. Moreover, this formulation also ensures that **mass, momentum, and energy are conserved** in each element, similarly to the FVM, which
makes DG methods suitable to solve partial differential equations written as conservation laws.

The code has been developed in the Applied Mathematics Department of the Aerospace School (Madrid Technical University). 

## Technical information

### Operating system

This code has been tested and its currently supported in:

  * **MacOSX** (OSX Sierra)
  * **Linux** (Ubuntu 14.04)
  
It still has not been tested in Windows OS.

###Â FORTRAN Compiler

This code has been tested with:

  * GNU Fortran version 6.3.0: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc.git
  * Intel Fortran 2017: https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers

Earlier versions may not be supported, since the code uses fortran submodules, which is a recent fortran 2008 feature.

### NetCDF Fortran Libraries

**Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)** libraries are required to run the code. This libraries are used for **high performance data files processing**, 
such as mesh and results files. Installing NetCDF libraries can be **tricky for the first time**. 
You can find all the information in their website:

https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

If you attempt a manual installation, recall that you will need this prerequisites to install NetCDF-C libraries.

  * HDF5 1.8.9 or later (for netCDF-4 support)
  * zlib 1.2.5 or later (for netCDF-4 compression)
  * curl 7.18.0 or later (for DAP remote access client support)


### Postprocessing tools

This code supports either **Tecplot** and **Paraview**. Using the former or the latter is selected by a runtime variable in each job case file.

## Program description:

This code is divided in three parts:

1. Common binaries, which are stored in the **./Solver/bin** folder. Two binaries are generated:

   * **HORSES2D.NS**: The **Navier-Stokes** equations solver.
   * **HORSES2D.Euler**: The **Euler** equations solver.

2. A shared library, named "**libproblemfile** which contain several case-dependant subroutines. A default **libproblemfile** library is compiled in **./Solver/lib**, which can be replaced in runtime by case specific libraries. During runtime, the binaries will link the library in this order:

   * In  **./SETUP/libproblemfile**: Case specific libproblemfile.
   * In **$(HORSES_PATH)/Solver/lib**: Default libproblemfile
   * In **$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)**: Additional path.
  
3. A case file which controls the simulation parameters. An example can be found [here](Utils/CaseFile/DefaultCaseFile.HiOCase). Flow and boundary conditions, solver parameters, and simulation configurations are selected in this file.

### Compilation


The code compilation uses GNU make (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The library dependencies (such as NetCDF, BLAS, and LAPACK) are speficied in a **make.inc** file. Once this file is placed in **./Solver**, the code is ready to be compiled:

```
    >> ./configure.sh
    >> cd ./Solver
    >> make allclean
    >> make COMPILER=gfortran/ifort MODE=DEBUG/RELEASE COMM=SERIAL/PARALLEL 
    >> make COMPILER=gfortran/ifort MODE=DEBUG/RELEASE COMM=SERIAL/PARALLEL Euler
```


This creates the binaries in the **./Solver/bin** folder, and the default **libproblemfile** library in the **./Solver/lib** folder.

Next, to compile a test case specific libproblemfile library, a Makefile.template can be found in each test case **./SETUP** folder, for instance:

```
  >> cd $(TEST_CASE)/SETUP
  >> make -f Makefile.template MODE=RELEASE/DEBUG COMPILER=ifort/gfortran COMM=SERIAL/PARALLEL
``` 

### Execution

The binary will look for the case file in the first command line argument, that is:


```
  >> HORSES2D.NS Casefile.HiOCase
```
